# Prompts

## System Architecture (ChatGPT)

```
Build a full architecture diagram for the following project. An AI assistant that is persistent on a users desktop (windows) for a the wake-word "Hey Aurora". The application will then capture a short voice command, and uses a Cloudflare Worker with Llama 3.3 and Durable Objects to interpret natural-language requests, modify a persistent personal calendar, and return human-readable responses. The tech stack used should include a background Electron listener, a React-based animated popup UI, a wake-word detection engine, an audio recording pipeline, and a Cloudflare AI backend that performs STT, LLM reasoning, intent parsing, and calendar state management.
