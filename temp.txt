You are working inside the “ui/” folder of the Aurora Assistant project. 
Implement a full TypeScript + React + Vite UI that is designed specifically 
to run as the renderer for the Electron popup window defined in electron/.

The UI will NOT run standalone — it must be built entirely in the context of:

1. electron/
   - electron/main.ts creates a transparent, frameless popup BrowserWindow
   - preload.ts exposes secure IPC functions:
       window.electronAPI.onWakeWord(callback)
       window.electronAPI.onAIResponse(callback)
   - wake-word detection happens in electron/, and the UI only responds to IPC

2. worker/
   - The Worker receives recorded audio and returns a JSON response:
       { response: string }
   - The UI simply displays the text returned by Electron via IPC

Your task: build a complete popup UI that displays:
- A circular glowing “AI orb” that pulses when listening
- A clean, modern text area that displays assistant responses
- Smooth fade-in and fade-out animations triggered via IPC
- Optional state transitions:
    • “Listening…”
    • “Processing…”
    • Showing the LLM reply

UI Requirements:

1. Technology:
   • TypeScript
   • React (functional components + hooks)
   • Vite dev server
   • CSS modules or a single popup.css file for animations
   • No external CSS frameworks unless absolutely necessary

2. IPC Integration:
   Implement listeners:


Do NOT call Node APIs directly — only through the preload bridge.

3. Popup Behavior:
- Default hidden
- When onWakeWord triggers:
     • popup fades in
     • AI orb pulses
     • text says: "Listening…"
- When onAIResponse triggers:
     • text changes to the assistant response
     • orb slows pulse or glows softly
- After a short delay (e.g., 3 seconds), fade out and hide.

4. Visual Design (important):
• Semi-transparent glassmorphic style popup
• The popup should float near bottom-right of the Electron window.
• The AI orb should be:
• Text should be clean, large, easy to read.
• Fade and scale transitions must be smooth (CSS transitions).

5. Export:
Implement everything required for Electron to load the UI.

Deliverables:
- Full React component code
- CSS animations and layout
- IPC event handlers
- Types for UI state
- Clean, production-ready structure
- Make sure UI runs as soon as Vite is started and Electron opens the window

Generate all necessary code files and ensure imports are valid.
